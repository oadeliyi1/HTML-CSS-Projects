- When you positon something relative, you are positioning it relative to its current position

-Absolute things will be positoned based on where its parent position. position the element  based on its
closest positioned ancestor position. it changes the layout

position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position:
absolute places an element relative to its parentâ€™s position and changing the layout around it.

so when we took the video container and made it's position absolute, we positioned it based on it's
parent (showcase) and changed the layout (the text) around it. this is why the text looked like it "moved
to where the video was.
